##Connecting to database

The project connects to the provided database usin gthe provided credentials. The credentials are stored in .env file, which is added to the .gitignore file.

##Database seeding

The database is seeded using a samll set of data. To simplify the development process, this set of data is used as both the test data and the development data. As the project grows, it would be better to creata a test data set and seprate the data into seprate data files rather than in seed.js.
